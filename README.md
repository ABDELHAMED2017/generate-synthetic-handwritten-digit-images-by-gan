# generate-synthetic-handwritten-digit-images-by-gan

Train and test Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to generate synthetic handwritten digit
images. Use the MNIST dataset. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of
10,000 examples. The examples are black and white images of handwritten digits, each with size
28x28 pixelsÂ². Preprocess* the data so training GANs becomes easier. (*Specifically, the input values which range in between [0, 255] will be normalized between -1 and 1.)
